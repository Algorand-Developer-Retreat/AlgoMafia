# AlgoMafia

Welcome to AlgoMafia.

Check out `projects/mafia-contract` to see the TEALscript written contract code.

Check out `projects/mafia-frontend` to access the game UI, also hosted [here](https://algomafia.onrender.com) if you wish to play. (Note that Safari doesn't work well with use-wallet.)

In a bid to be more original, rather than following a mafia/werewolf style theme, the frontend is called **Infiltrated**. You play as members of a cypherpunk resistance group, fighting against an Orwellian surveillance state. Using privacy-preserving technologies (a nod to the Ring Signature technology that are a core of this repo), you have been able to survive... up until now.

Your group has been infiltrated (the "Mafia/Werewolf" role) and your comrades picked off one by one. It is up to the good guys to figure out who is the in

Luckily, your group has a secret "Double Agent"/"Hacker" member (the "Doctor"/"Guardian Angel" role) who is feeding counter-intelligence to the overlords, interfering with the Spy. But to avoid being killed they must also keep themselves secret.
